	    	<p>Soundwave plays songs and turns the waveform into an animated landscape with the colors of the album as the primary landscape gradient. It uses the p5.js library along with some basic HTML and CSS to display the dynamic landscape over time. I was the project leader and programmer for a team of 5 - two designers and three programmers. We created this project as part of Corpus Callosum, an art and engineering club at USC.</p>

	    	<p>My first semester in Corpus Callosum, I collaborated with a team of 3 to design, lasercut, wire, and code this dynamic art and social commentary installation. We took the LA crime data from January 2018 to November 2018 and distilled it to approximately 119 gun deaths which we represented with LEDs that would flash and go out over time. We also included a mix of gunshot sounds that would go off whenever one of the LEDs flashed, creating an immersive and impactful experience.</p>
