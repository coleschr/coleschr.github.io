	    	<p>I organized my team of six to ensure efficient completion of work. I also created the initial database structure and helped design the user experience and interaction components.</p>

	    	<p>Rain Rain Sleep Sounds is a mobile app that offers dozens of high quality sounds meant to help you fall asleep. The app has over 100,000 users and 4.7 stars on Google Play.</p>

	    	<p>For this project, I redesigned interface for ease of use, refactored code for app stability, added subscriptions for premium sounds, and implemented advertisement banners. I learned to work with Java and Kotlin media players, intents, services, notifications, persistent data, and more.</p>

	    	<p>Imprint was a project I created from an empty single view app to publishing on the app store. I implemented gesture recognizers, dynamic positioning of option buttons, and rendering text onto images. I inserted external libraries, adapted a sliding color picker, created a variety of text customizing options, and learned Swift along the way.</p>

	    	<p>Soundwave plays songs and turns the waveform into an animated landscape with the colors of the album as the primary landscape gradient. It uses the p5.js library along with some basic HTML and CSS to display the dynamic landscape over time. I was the project leader and programmer for a team of 5 - two designers and three programmers. We created this project as part of Corpus Callosum, an art and engineering club at USC.</p>

	    	<h3>LED Map of Gun Deaths in Los Angeles (Fall 2018)</h3>

	    	<p>My first semester in Corpus Callosum, I collaborated with a team of 3 to design, lasercut, wire, and code this dynamic art and social commentary installation. We took the LA crime data from January 2018 to November 2018 and distilled it to approximately 119 gun deaths which we represented with LEDs that would flash and go out over time. We also included a mix of gunshot sounds that would go off whenever one of the LEDs flashed, creating an immersive and impactful experience.</p>

	    	<p>Terraforming Mars was a collaborative learning and experimenting environment hosted by the Sidney Harman Academy of Polymathic Study. The collaboratory brought 6 students and 2 faculty together to discuss and explore the topic of Terraforming Mars</p>

	    	<p>I wrote a joint research paper based on a 3 month experiment with 3 other students investigating the viability of Martian soil as a plant growth medium.</p>

	    	<p>I helped design an interactive educational virtual reality experience exploring some methods and consequences of Martian terraforming.</p>

	    	<p>Danger Party is a bluetooth multiplayer cooperative game based on Spaceteam. Players are prompted to complete certain on their device or tell other players and have them complete the task before time runs out.</p>

	    	<p>I designed, prototyped, and implemented the game with a team of 3. My main role was in designing the levels, user interface, graphics, and interactive buttons, but I also helped with bluetooth connections and game state logic.</p>
